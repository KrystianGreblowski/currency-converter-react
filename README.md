# Currency converter

## Description

It's a currency converter for Polish currency to others. It's an application I created as part of a project for the YouCode Frontend Developer course.

The latest exchange rates are downloaded from https://exchangerate.host/#/ 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
